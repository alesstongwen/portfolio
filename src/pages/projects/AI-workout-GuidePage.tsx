              Beep is a safety app that provides real-time safety insights and
              proactive emergency features to offer peace of mind, especially
              for women, people of color, and underrepresented communities
              navigating alone. The project was a collaboration with the D3
              (Digital Design and Development) program and won 3rd place in the
              final showcase among 9 other teams.

              One of the main challenges was integrating real-time location
              tracking with Firebase. Ensuring that the app works reliably in
              areas with poor GPS signals was another obstacle.

            <p className="mt-4">
              Building Beep was an eye-opening experience, as it allowed me to
              work with React Native and integrate multiple APIs. It was also
              rewarding to create an app that can potentially help people feel
              safer in their everyday lives.
