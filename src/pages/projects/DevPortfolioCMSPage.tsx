              The Dev Portfolio CMS is a full-stack web application that allows
              users to create, edit, and manage their project portfolios. The
              project features a dynamic dashboard where users can add project
              details such as title, description, GitHub link, and an image.
              Users can also modify and delete their projects. It was built
              using PHP, Laravel, and Docker for the backend. This was a solo
              project.

              A major challenge faced was ensuring proper file upload and
              handling large file sizes on different hosting environments. The
              development process was also affected by setting up the backend
              and the interaction between Laravel, Docker, and TypeScript,
              ensuring smooth deployment.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Building this CMS provided me with valuable experience in
              developing a full-stack project using PHP and Laravel. It also
              enhanced my understanding of Docker and cloud deployment. I'm
              currently working on integrating it as the backend for my
              portfolio, which will help make the frontend lighter and faster.
