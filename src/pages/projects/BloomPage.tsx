              Bloom is a social media app that creates community for people
              based on their aura color. Users can take a quiz to determine
              their aura color and then join a community of people with the same
              aura color. Users can post, comment, and like posts within their
              community as well as events.

              One of the main challenges was integrating real-time location
              tracking with Firebase. Ensuring that the app works reliably in
              areas with poor GPS signals was another obstacle.

              Building Beep was an eye-opening experience, as it allowed me to
              work with React Native and integrate multiple APIs. It was also
              rewarding to create an app that can potentially help people feel
              safer in their everyday lives.
